# Gradient Guide Decision Tree

`Gradient Guide Decision Tree` is modification of gradient boost decision tree, 
whcih share the same iterative schemes of gradient decsent method in continous optimization.

Some toy examples show it is competive with gradient boost descision tree in the .ipython file.
